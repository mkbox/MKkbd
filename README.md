# MKkbd
Programmable keyboard controller.

Project based on V-USB library, firmware precompiled for atmega8a with 12MHz quartz.
v1.x - controller supports up to 17 keys with 4 layouts, stored in EEMEM (you can switch between layouts by installing jumper link on board).

## Installation
Software part (charset changer) comes in 2 variants. First one is standalone package with jre included and doesn't require any third-party apps, so no there's need to install app, just unpack and launch. Second package contains only app itself and you must have jre 1.8 installed.
